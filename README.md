The app uses NodeJS for the backend, Express for the API, SQLite for the database and Bootstrap for the frontend.

By default the app is configure to use the **Whisper** model from OpenAI from Speech-to-Text, **ChatGPT** model also from OpenAI to generate a response, and **Google Cloud** for the Text-To-Speech.

To run the app with these models, you'll have to provide your own API keys. Instructions on how to aquire them can be found below.

Besides these, adding and configuring new models can be quickly done through the defined steps.

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 14.6.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

```
$ cd voi-to-voi
```

4. Install the requirements

```
$ npm install
```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

On Linux systems:

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```
On Windows:

```
$ copy .env.example .env
```

6. Add your API keys to the newly created .env file. In the case of the Google Cloud API Keys, point to the file where the API keys are saved.
  - If you don't have API keys for OpenAI or Google Cloud but you still want to use their models, you can get their API keys here:
    - [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
    - [Google Cloud API Keys](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/before-you-begin)

7. Run the app

```
$ npm start
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://localhost:3000!
